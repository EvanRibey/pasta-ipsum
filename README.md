# :spaghetti: Pasta Themed Lorum Ipsum Generator
A small vanilla Typescript web app built with Material components that generates pasta themed lorum ipsum placeholder text.

The app takes in a number to indicate how many sentences or paragraphs need to be generated. All single page instead of multipage like a handful of alternatives.

## Personal Comments
I've seen a couple other themed ipsum generators, and thought pasta-based would be fun to make. I didn't know there were this many types of pasta though which made it more interesting.

Coming off of making the E1RM calculator, I wanted to continue to use Typescript and Material components to reinforce my understanding of both. I felt I was able to move faster and knew what to expect while developing.
